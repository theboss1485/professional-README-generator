# Professional README Generator

## Description 

My motivation for building this project was to gain experience with using both the inquirer package and NodeJS.  I built this project so that I could write a meaningful JavaScript application and then learn how to invoke it via the command line, using NodeJS.  This project solves the problem of a programmer needing to generate professional READMEs for his or her projects more quickly.  This project lets the user enter in their responses to several questions and then creates a markdown file with those responses.  In this project, I learned the basics of using the inquirer module, and run an application from the command line using NodeJS.

## Usage

To view the code for this application, please go to my GitHub profile here: [https://github.com/theboss1485/professional-README-generator](https://github.com/theboss1485/professional-README-generator).

To use the application first make sure NodeJS is installed on your computer. Next, clone the GitHub repository with the "git clone" command.  Then, navigate to the project folder in the command line and type "node index.js", without the quote marks.  This will start the application and the system will begin by asking the user a series of questions.  Type an answer to each question and press Enter.  After the program has finished asking questions, the check the project's folder.  You should see a new file titled generatedREADME.md.  Feel free to rename this file.  I decided not to name the file README.md because running the program would then overwrite the README I am currently writing.

I took a regular expression from [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/checking-for-valid-email-address-using-regular-expressions-in-java](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/checking-for-valid-email-address-using-regular-expressions-in-java) and modified it as necessary.

I used a tutorial found at [masteringjs.io](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/regex-not-starting-with#:~:text=Make%20sure%20your%20regular%20expression,the%20start%20of%20the%20string.&text=Another%20approach%20is%20to%20use,the%20set%20negates%20the%20set.) to help with writing a regular expression.  Please feel free to visit the tutorial by clicking on the link.

I used the Xpert Learning Assistant AI chatbot to help with writing regular expressions.

I also used [regex101.com](regex101.com) to help with writing regular expressions.
